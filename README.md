# d3charts

A higher-level charting library built on top of [d3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3).

D3 is really quite awesome. It is a low-level toolkit of primitives for visualizing data in modern browsers, abstracting away a lot of the common gruntwork of any visualization. I like to think of d3 as the web's "native" visualization language, since it isn't a very abstract abstraction: d3 produces SVG and maniupulates markup in your browser, not some intermediate representation. This makes things like interactivity possible/easier.

### So why a charting library?

With great power comes great headache. Even if you're familiar with graphics programming, finding your way around d3 can be a little intimidating at first. Sometimes you just want a basic chart of something, and you'd like the option of later adding on bells and whistles. D3charts aims to supply that, as well as serving as a good library of examples to learn/steal from if you want to implement your own charts.

### Steal?

It's all good, komrade! We are being supply code under license "BSD" of three clause. Use and abuse required immediately now. Making sure to read `LICENSE` file.

### Pull requests?

Hell yes, please.
